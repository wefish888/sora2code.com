One of the most exciting innovations in OpenAI's newly launched Sora 2 is the **Cameo feature** – a groundbreaking capability that allows users to insert themselves and their friends into AI-generated video scenes. This feature transforms Sora 2 from a simple video generator into a platform for personalized, social content creation.

The Cameo feature enables users to become "actors" in AI-generated videos by creating a digital representation of their appearance and voice. Once set up, you can appear in any video scenario you can imagine – from action sequences to dramatic performances, comedy sketches to music videos.
